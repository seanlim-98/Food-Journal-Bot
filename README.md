# Food-Journal-Bot
An automated bot created using Python and the Telegram Bot API that allows users to keep a food journal of food establishments they have been to. The bot allows them to not just record the places they've been to but also provides commands for them to rate the places and receive recommendations on places to go to based on their rating histories, other users' ratings and their own frequencies of visiting different establishments.
